# About RMod
Well, you are here.

And this is our small project -> **Rainbow 6S Mod**.

We call it **RMod** because it's for Rainbow 6S (obviously).
And it modificates (change; add or replace files) your game file system.

Blitz round:
* No, there are no viruses in here. You are allowed check it yourself >> virustotal.com
* Don't like the design? We have a budget big enough for only one Silicon Valley designer. We accept donations if you want to help us enhance our design
* Why the app is only around 3 mb? It downloads everything from cloud
* You don't really need to download the app every time game gets updated. Most of the times changes come to the design
* Yes, press the "Check" button if something is broken. That's what it's for. It may or may not fix everything
* Unfortunately we can't implement self-update system. Maybe later. Or not. 

**Nah, no more "to-do" or "near future plans"**

## Social
